2. **Pipeline Overview (0:30–1:30)**
   - Show Snakemake graph and mention CLI (`scimmuneatlas integrate`).
   - Emphasize new QC plots, Scrublet diagnostics, and integration metrics.
3. **Biological Insights (1:30–3:00)**
   - Open the interpretation notebook, run UMAP overlays, discuss T cell states.
   - Mention benchmarking results and how they validate integration quality.
4. **Portfolio Call-to-Action (3:00–3:30)**
