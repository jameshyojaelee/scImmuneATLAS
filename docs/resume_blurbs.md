# scImmuneATLAS Resume Blurbs

- Engineered an end-to-end single-cell immune atlas pipeline (QC → doublet diagnostics → Harmony/scVI integration → marker-driven annotation) with a typed CLI and Snakemake workflow, enabling reproducible delivery of annotated `.h5ad` releases and cellxgene-ready packages.
- Built automated quality dashboards and regression metrics (QC summaries, Scrublet histograms, integration silhouette/LISI, annotation confusion matrices) that surface dataset-level health signals within minutes of ingest.
- Added modular receptor/TCR analytics that harmonise raw contig tables, compute repertoire diversity/overlap, and generate publication-quality figures for interview-ready storytelling.
- Hardened developer UX with `make demo`, idempotent CLI entry points, and regression tests covering workflow orchestration, reducing portfolio refresh time to under 10 minutes.
